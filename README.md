# Speed Dating with Tinder

## Company's description ðŸ“‡

<a href="https://tinder.com/" target="_blank">Tinder</a> is an online dating and geosocial networking application. In Tinder, users "swipe right" to like or "swipe left" to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photos, a short bio, and a list of their interests. 

Tinder was launched by Sean Rad at a hackathon held at the Hatch Labs incubator in West Hollywood in 2012.

As of 2021, Tinder has recorded more than 65 billion matches worldwide.

## Project ðŸš§

The marketing team needs help on a new project. They are experiencing a decrease in the number of matches, and they are trying to find a way to understand **what makes people interested into each other**. 

They decided to run a speed dating experiment with people who had to give Tinder lots of informations about themselves that could ultimately reflect on ther dating profile on the app.

Tinder then gathered the data from this experiment. Each row in the dataset represents one speed date between two people, and indicates wether each of them secretly agreed to go on a second date with the other person.

## Deliverable ðŸ“¬

To complete this project, your team should deliver:

A notebook with:
* descriptive statistics
* visualisations
* captions and interpretations on how the stats and visualisations are relevant to why people agree to a second date

## In this repository you can find:
- _Speed+Dating+Data.csv_ dataset in the folder _data_
- a _requirements.txt_ file for necessary packages
- _Speed+Dating+Data+Key.doc_ which contains a detailed dataset and variable description
- *Speed_Dating_Project.ipynb* notebook for the exploratory data analysis, visualizations and comments
